# BookingFrame

A booking page's frame (spec 0025, 0025-experience.md; laid out as the timefix booking page, the owner's call on 20 October 2026): the host in a rail of their own (a large picture, the name, the meeting as the page's `h1`, its facts, and a "Powered by Timefix" card pinned at the rail's foot), beside one card: a heading row with Month or List, the month and the day's times side by side (the times scroll inside their pane at the month's height), and a band across the foot for the Book bar. Under the page breakpoint everything stacks and Timefix moves to the page's end, centred. This folder also holds `BookingFoot` (that foot alone, for the guest's booking page) and `BookingMessage` (one small card for a page with nothing to book: loading, not found, paused, or failed with Try again).

## Why it exists

New. The public booking page moved onto the library on 20 October 2026 (as the hosted form did), and no layout held a rail beside a card of two panes. PageColumn and PreviewLayout are app pages inside the shell; AuthLayout is one narrow card.

## Use

```tsx
<BookingFrame
  host={{ name: 'Ada Lovelace' }}
  title="Intro call · 30 min"
  facts={[{ id: 'where', icon: 'video', children: 'Video call' }]}
  heading="Choose a time"
  toolbar={<SegmentedControl … />}
  aside={<SlotList … />}
  footer={<Button variant="primary" size="lg" isFullWidth="center">Book</Button>}
  claimHref="https://timefix.ai"
>
  <MonthTiles … />
</BookingFrame>
```

`aside` adds the end pane; leave it off for one wide pane (the details step). `footer` is the band across the card's foot. A fact's `children` may be a control (the time zone's Select). `banner` sits above the card (the visitor's calendar, spec 0028). Without `host` and `title` the frame draws skeletons.

## States

Three panes, two panes, loading; BookingMessage's loading, message and Try again.

## Keyboard

None of its own. BookingMessage focuses its heading as it shows.

## Differences from the artifact

Not in the artifact.
